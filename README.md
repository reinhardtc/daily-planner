## Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This is a simple daily planner application for the hours of 9AM-5PM. Each hour block has an editable text area. When the text is added, the user clicks the blue "save" button on the right hand side of the screen. The content of the corresponding text area is saved to local storage. When the user refreshes or returns to the application, the content of that hour is still there from local storage. As the day progresses, the colors of each text area change from gray (a past hour block), red (the current hour block), or green (a future hour block.)
